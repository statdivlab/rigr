However, navigating regression analyses R can challenging, especially biomedical researchers limited programming experience. particular, fitting commonly-used regression models (e.g., linear, logistic, Poisson, proportional hazards regressions) requires different functions R, possessing function-specific syntax. creates unnecessary burden hinders learners making conceptual connections related regression models. Barriers entry even higher obtaining customized, “modern” inferential results. instance, heteroskedasticity-robust (-called “sandwich”) standard errors, robust certain misspecified variance covariance structures outcome variables [@king2015robust; @Mansournia2021-cd], provided default popular lm, glm, coxph functions R. Moreover, researchers want perform joint inference linear combination regression coefficients, need manually extract robust standard errors call specialized packages perform calculation. summary, combining existing packages R can provide necessary tools simple advanced analyses, process laden unnecessary complexity details. designed rigr package lower barriers obtaining robust interpretable regression results R; emphasise connections commonly-used statistical models; facilitate use distribution-free inference tools regression. single regression function regress can fit linear models, frequently-used generalized linear models, proportional hazards models, output regress call displays exponentiated coefficients confidence intervals appropriate. Together, allows researchers () make connections different classes models, (ii) easily report estimated coefficients interpretable scale (e.g., odds ratio logistic regressions hazard ratio proportional hazards regressions). Moreover, heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors used inference default, tests linear contrasts multiple partial F-tests (e.g., testing null hypothesis multiple regression coefficients equal zero) easy specify. means rigr users can easily test multiple linear hypotheses (includes ANOVA special case) robust standard error estimates single function (lincom anova), presently requires pooling results multiple packages R (including stats [@stats-package], survival [@survival-package], sandwich [@sandwich-package] car [@car-package]). Finally, package also provides easy--use functions descriptive statistics, one- two-sample inference clearly formated outputs. designing outputs functions rigr, deliberately include key information inferential results omitting additional details might confusing newcomers regression analyses.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://statdivlab.github.io/rigr/paper.html","id":"regress-general-regression-for-an-arbitrary-functional","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"regress: General Regression for an Arbitrary Functional","title":"Summary","text":"first demonstrate use regress function, single function can used fit linear, logistic, Poisson, proportional hazards regressions depending specified fnctl argument. following example, use regress fit linear regression model atrophy (measure global brain activity assessed using MRI) sex, weight, age, race. see robust standard error estimates reported default, results F-test null hypothesis difference mean atrophy across populations matched sex, weight age differ self-reported racial categories. mri dataset represents subset Cardiovascular Health Study dataset [@kuller2007white]. order preserve patient anonymity facilitate use classroom, data modified adding random noise rescaling variables. modifications preserved general relationships among variables dataset. next set code demonstrates regress can used run regression models. cases, outputs include exponentiated coefficients (.e., coefficients odds ratio hazard ratio scales, respectively) default.","code":"# Loading library and dataset library(rigr) library(dplyr) data(mri) # renaming category for display purposes mri$race_display <- recode(mri$race,  \"Subject did not identify as White, Black or Asian\" = \"Others\") regress(fnctl = \"mean\", atrophy ~ sex + weight + age + race_display, data = mri)  # Residuals: #     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max # -34.053  -8.469  -0.538   7.405  54.071  # Coefficients: #                     Estimate  Naive SE  Robust SE    95%L      95%H # [1] Intercept        -22.71     7.646     8.098       -38.61    -6.813 # [2] sexMale           5.441     0.9977    1.034        3.411     7.470 # [3] weight           0.01998   0.01672   0.01787     -0.01510   0.05505 # [4] age               0.7153   0.08478   0.09125       0.5361    0.8944 #     race_display # [5]    Black         -2.387     2.109     2.055       -6.422     1.648 # [6]    Others        -3.135     3.885     4.148       -11.28     5.008 # [7]    White         -0.2016    1.822     1.790       -3.716     3.313 #                     F stat    df    Pr(>F) # [1] Intercept        7.87     1     0.0052 # [2] sexMale          27.70    1     < 0.00005 # [3] weight           1.25     1     0.2639 # [4] age              61.45    1     < 0.00005 #     race_display     1.23     3     0.2992 # [5]    Black         1.35     1     0.2459 # [6]    Others        0.57     1     0.4500 # [7]    White         0.01     1     0.9104  # Residual standard error: 11.99 on 728 degrees of freedom # Multiple R-squared:  0.1456,  Adjusted R-squared:  0.1385 # F-statistic: 18.17 on 6 and 728 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16 # Logistic regression of atrophy on sex height, weight, race, and # a degree-2 polynomial of ldl. regress(fnctl = \"odds\", diabetes ~ height+weight*sex +  polynomial(ldl, 2), data = mri)  # Fitting a proportional hazards regression (Cox regression). library(survival) regress(fnctl = \"hazard\", Surv(obstime, death)~age+race, data=mri)"},{"path":"https://statdivlab.github.io/rigr/paper.html","id":"testing-linear-hypotheses","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Testing linear hypotheses","title":"Summary","text":"now demonstrate produce point estimates, interval estimates, p-values linear combinations regression coefficients using rigr.","code":"# Linear regression of LDL on age, stroke, and race (with robust SE by default) ldl_reg <- regress (\"mean\", ldl~age+stroke, data = mri)  # Testing coefficient created by .5*age - stroke (the first 0 comes # from excluding the intercept) single_comb <- c(0, 0.5, -1) lincom(ldl_reg, single_comb)  # H0: 0.5*age-1*stroke   =  0 # Ha: 0.5*age-1*stroke  !=  0 #      Estimate Std.
