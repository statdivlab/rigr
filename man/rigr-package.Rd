\title{Regression, Inference, and General Data Analysis Tools in R}
\description{
Developed by Scott S. Emerson, Andrew J. Spieker, Brian D.
Williamson, and Travis Y. Hee Wai at the University of
Washington Department of Biostatistics. Currently maintained by
Prof. Amy Willis at the University of Washington Department of Biostatistics.
Previously maintained by Charles Wolock and Taylor Okonek, also at the
University of Washington Department of Biostatistics. Aims to facilitate
regression, descriptive statistics, and one- and two-sample
inference by implementing more intuitive layout and functionality for
existing R functions.

\tabular{ll}{ Package: \tab rigr\cr Type: \tab Package\cr Version:
\tab 1.0.0\cr Date: \tab 2021-09-10\cr License: \tab MIT\cr } A set of
tools designed to facilitate easy adoption of R for students in introductory
classes with little programming experience. Compiles output from existing
routines together in an intuitive format, and adds functionality to existing
functions. For instance, the regression function can perform linear models
and generalized linear models. The user can also specify multiple-partial F-tests
to print out with the model coefficients, and robust standard errors are
provided automatically. We also provide functions for descriptive statistics and one-
and two-sample inference with improved, legible output.
